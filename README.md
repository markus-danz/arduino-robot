# Arduino Robot

Around the time I started my studies in Computer Science, I got an Arduino Uno microcontroller for my birthday. After playing around with it for a bit, I knew pretty quickly that I wanted to use it to build my own robot. I bought the parts and got to work...

### Features

- Remote controlled driving via bluetooth
- Autonomous driving using 3 ultrasonic sensors
- LCD Display showing current driving mode
- 2 front and 2 back LED lights, 1 front LED strip
- 1 Buzzer/Horn

### Hardware

Below is everything I used to build the robot. Most of the parts are easy to find and your standard Arduino project accessories. However, I still added links to some of the components to easier find the exact modules used in this particular build.
